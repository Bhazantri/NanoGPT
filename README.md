# NanoGPT
Building Neural networks from scratch 
We start with the basics of backpropagation and build up to modern deep neural networks, like GPT. In my opinion language models are an excellent place to learn deep learning, even if your intention is to eventually go to other areas like computer vision because most of what you learn will be immediately transferable. This is why we dive into and focus on languade models.
Prerequisites: solid programming (Python), intro-level math (e.g. derivative, gaussian).
